Run main.py by using the command line argument: "python main.py --rand <x> <filename1> [<filename2> ...]" in the correct directory, where x = the number of minimal upper bounds to generate.

When running a minimality check, enter the minimal upperbound as the first file.

"python main.py <filename1>" can be ran as well, and this will display a matrix as an ellipsoid.
